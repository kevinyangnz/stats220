### Number of buses

```{r}

## Mean vehicles seen 
mean_vehicles_seen <- mean(latest_data$vehicles_seen)

## Max pedestrians seen
max_pedestrians_seen <- max(latest_data$pedestrians_seen)

```

### Average number of vehicles seen

The average number of driven vehicles seen in 15 minute intervals is `r round(mean_vehicles_seen, 1)`.

### Highest number of pedestrians seen

The most pedestrians seen in a 15 minute interval is `r max_pedestrians_seen`.
